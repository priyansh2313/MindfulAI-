## 🌟 Key Features

- 🎭 **Mood Detection**  
  Parses natural text like “I feel hopeless” or “I’m exhausted” and maps it to core mood labels like `sad`, `anxious`, `burnt_out`, `angry`, etc.

- 🧠 **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**  
  Learns over time which activities (music, journaling, breathing) work best for each user's mood and adapts dynamically.

- 💬 **Short-Circuited LLM Support**  
  Uses an LLM chatbot only if no actionable mood is detected — reducing hallucinations and improving reliability.

- 🎯 **RL + Feedback Loop**  
  Tracks how users respond to suggestions and updates Q-values accordingly. Exploration rate decays automatically for better personalization.

- 🪐 **Visual & Engaging UI**  
  Built with React, TailwindCSS, Vanta.js backgrounds, floating chatbot UI, and animations for a calming user experience.
